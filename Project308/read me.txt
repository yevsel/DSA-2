The interface of the software is saved as App.png
It may be different for u cos the icons and images are not packed with project. 
However, these files are saved in the icons folder in the project folder
U can go ahead and insert them by comparing the App.png
But that isn't your task. Go ahead and implement the backend. After everything,
I'll build the files and packages.
